    <img src="assets/images/dave1.jpeg" alt="my pic" width="180" height="auto" />
    <p>David Obinta is the fourth child in the family, with three siblings: two elder sisters and one elder brother, making me the youngest. Born in the early 2000s (the Gen Z era). I have learned self-discipline, commitment, focus, and diligence in achieving set goals. I am currently studying <b>Biomedical Technology</b> at the university, a course that combines medicine and engineering to build lifelines for patients who seem to have lost hope due to various predicaments.</p>

    <h2>Why I Joined Alt School Africa</h2>
    <p>I joined AltSchool Africa through my sponsor mentor, who I reached out to for work experience. He recommended studying in a learning space to be in a community with the same vision while engaging in self-learning. My aim at AltSchool Africa is to explore the tech path, understand what it’s like to be a <b>Cloud Engineer</b>, <b>get certified</b>, and <b>provide solutions</b> in the tech space.</p>
